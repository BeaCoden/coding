# Description

I will use this repository to store my coding tasks and katas from coding-bootcamps-europe and codewars.
Folders and files are organized as follows:

```kata -> cbe -> kata.name-list -> kata-subfolder -> kata-name.js, kata-name.html, kata-name.css and readme.md```
```kata -> codewars -> kata.name-list -> kata-subfolder -> kata-name.js, kata-name.html and readme.md```

```tasks -> cbe -> task-name-list -> task-subfolder -> task-name.js, task-name.html, task-name.css & readme.md```
